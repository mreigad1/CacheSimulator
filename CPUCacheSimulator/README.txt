Cache Simulator

Program will simulate cache accesses under different CPU cache
eviction policies and will compare performance of each such policy.

Note:
Behavior will be undefined for files not containing exactly 2 millions lines.

Note:
To run the extra-credit implementations, see:

#define testing false

at the top of main.cpp. Change it to:

#define testing true

then compile and run the program normally. Results from the extra credit
implementations will output to the command line in an easy to read format,
along with the results from the regular implementation.
